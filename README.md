# Mini-Uber-Project
Making a Mini-Uber project that has login and register pages for both user and driver
Users can request a ride with different types of rides with varying prices for each ride and the driver can accept the ride or cancel it.
Users can pay for the ride with different payments.
We are collaborating on a project that uses Java, OOP and adhering to Design Pattern Principles.
